# ProgrammingAssignment
This is a simple pyhton program, made in prgramiz.com. It simulates a security system. The security engine will unlock the lock when it finds the correct access code. 
#
In part 2, the code estimates how long it would take to break the lock if an intruder did not know the length of the access string. The code then repeats this process 10 times and reports the minimum, maximum, and average number of digits that were input before the lock was unlocked.
